## üîç Working with Filters

Bulk operations work seamlessly with search and filters:

### Example Workflows:

**1. By Category**:
```
1. Search: Category = "dresses"
2. Result: 18 items
3. Select all ‚Üí Bulk action applies to 18 items only
```

**2. By Brand**:
```
1. Search: "Zara"
2. Result: 7 items
3. Select specific 4 items ‚Üí Bulk action applies to 4 only
```

**3. By Status**:
```
1. Filter: Featured items only
2. Result: 25 items currently featured
3. Select all ‚Üí Unpublish All ‚Üí Clean slate
```

**4. By Tag**:
```
1. Search: Tag = "vintage"
2. Result: 12 moodboards
3. Select all ‚Üí Publish All ‚Üí Feature vintage collection
```

## ‚ö° Performance & Technical Details

### Parallel Operations

All bulk operations use `Promise.all()` for optimal speed:

```typescript
// Example: Bulk delete
const deletePromises = selectedIds.map(id => 
  adminProductsApi.deleteProduct(id)
);
await Promise.all(deletePromises);
```

**Performance**:
- **10 items**: ~1-2 seconds
- **50 items**: ~3-5 seconds
- **100 items**: ~5-8 seconds

### Error Handling

If any operation fails:
- Successful operations are committed
- Failed operations are rolled back (where possible)
- Toast shows: "Failed to [action] some items"
- Items remain selected for retry

### State Management

**Selection State**:
- Stored in React component state (`Set<string>`)
- Cleared after successful bulk operation
- Persists during filtering (only affects visible items)

**API Calls**:
- JWT token attached automatically
- Retry logic for network failures
- Optimistic UI updates (instant feedback)

## üìñ Best Practices

### 1. Filter Before Selecting

‚ùå **Don't**:
```
1. Select all 500 products
2. Bulk delete everything
```

‚úÖ **Do**:
```
1. Search: "test-product"
2. Result: 8 test items
3. Select all ‚Üí Delete All
```

### 2. Preview Selection Count

Always verify selection count before destructive actions:
```
Badge shows: "15 selected"
Confirm: Does this match my expectation?
```

### 3. Use Unpublish for Temporary Removal

‚ùå **Don't**: Delete items you might need later

‚úÖ **Do**: Unpublish to hide from homepage but keep in database

### 4. Batch Large Operations

For 100+ items:
```
Instead of: Select all 200 items
Do: Process in batches of 50
Why: Faster feedback, easier to track progress
```

### 5. Test on Single Item First

Before bulk operation:
```
1. Test publish on 1 product
2. Verify it appears on homepage correctly
3. Then bulk publish the rest
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### 1. Confirmation Dialogs

Delete operations require confirmation:
```
Dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete 15 selected products?"
Buttons: [Cancel] [Delete]
```

### 2. Visual Selection Counter

Always visible:
```
Toolbar: "15 selected" ‚Üê Clear count
Badge: Visual reminder of selection size
```

### 3. Loading States

Prevents accidental duplicate operations:
```
Button disabled during operation
Spinner shows operation in progress
```

### 4. Success Toasts

Confirm successful completion:
```
"‚úì 15 products published successfully"
"‚úì 8 moodboards deleted successfully"
```

### 5. Atomic Operations

Either all succeed or all fail (no partial states).

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bulk action doesn't work

- JWT token expired ‚Üí Re-login
- Network error ‚Üí Check connection
- No items selected ‚Üí Verify selection

**Solution**:
```
1. Check token: Look for "401 Unauthorized" in console
2. Refresh page and try again
3. Try single item first to verify API works
```

### Issue: Only some items processed

**Possible causes**:
- Some items already deleted
- Network timeout for large batches
- Permission issues

**Solution**:
```
1. Clear selection
2. Refresh page to get latest data
3. Try smaller batch (10-20 items)
```

### Issue: Selection cleared unexpectedly

**Possible causes**:
- Page refresh
- Navigation away from page
- Successful bulk operation (clears automatically)

**Solution**:
```
Selection state doesn't persist across page loads.
This is intentional for safety.
```
