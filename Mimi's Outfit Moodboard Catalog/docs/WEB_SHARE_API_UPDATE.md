# Web Share API Priority Update

## What Changed

The ShareButton component has been updated to **prioritize the native Web Share API** as the primary sharing method, with WhatsApp as a secondary option.

---

## Changes Summary

### Before
- WhatsApp share was listed first in dropdown
- Native share was secondary option
- Less intuitive for users wanting to share to other apps

### After ✅
- **Native Web Share API is listed first** (primary method)
- WhatsApp share is second option (specialized use case)
- Copy link remains as fallback
- Better UX - users see "Share..." first, which opens system share sheet

---

## Dropdown Menu Order

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Share...            │ ← Primary: Native Web Share API (NEW POSITION)
├─────────────────────┤
│ Share to WhatsApp   │ ← Secondary: WhatsApp-specific
├─────────────────────┤
│ Copy Link           │ ← Fallback: Always available
└─────────────────────┘
```

## Why This Change?

### Better User Experience
- ✅ **More intuitive** - "Share..." is standard across apps
- ✅ **More options** - Share to ANY app (not just WhatsApp)
- ✅ **Familiar interface** - Uses device's native share sheet
- ✅ **Better for non-WhatsApp users** - Email, Messages, Instagram, etc.

### Technical Benefits
- ✅ **Native implementation** - Uses device capabilities
- ✅ **Image blob support** - Shares full images on iOS/Android
- ✅ **No external dependencies** - Pure Web Share API
- ✅ **Graceful fallback** - WhatsApp and Copy Link still available

## Code Changes

### ShareButton.tsx

**Component Order Update:**
```tsx
<DropdownMenuContent align="end" className="w-48">
  {/* Primary: Native Web Share API (shows system share sheet) */}
  {hasNativeShare && (
    <DropdownMenuItem onClick={handleNativeShare}>
      <Share2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
      <span>Share...</span>
    </DropdownMenuItem>
  )}
  
  {/* WhatsApp-specific share with formatted message */}
  <DropdownMenuItem onClick={handleWhatsAppShare}>
    <MessageCircle className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 text-green-600" />
    <span>Share to WhatsApp</span>
  </DropdownMenuItem>
  
  {/* Fallback: Copy link */}
  <DropdownMenuItem onClick={handleCopyLink}>
    <Link2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
    <span>Copy Link</span>
  </DropdownMenuItem>
</DropdownMenuContent>
```
