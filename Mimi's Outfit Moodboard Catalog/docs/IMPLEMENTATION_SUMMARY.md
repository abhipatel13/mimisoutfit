### 2. **API Mode Switching** 🆕

Flexible API system that allows seamless switching between mock data and real backend API.

#### Files Updated:
- `/src/config/api.config.ts` - Enhanced with new flags
- `/src/services/api/admin.api.ts` - Added real mode support
- `/src/services/api/base.api.ts` - Added FormData support

#### Features:
- ✅ Mock mode for development (local data)
- ✅ Real mode for production (backend API)
- ✅ Automatic JWT header injection
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Debug mode for API request logging

#### Configuration:
```env
# API Mode
VITE_API_MODE=mock          # or 'real'

# Real API Settings
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_API_DEBUG=false
```

#### Backend Endpoints Supported:
```
Authentication:
  POST   /auth/login
  POST   /auth/logout
  GET    /auth/validate

Admin Products:
  POST   /admin/products
  PUT    /admin/products/:id
  DELETE /admin/products/:id
  POST   /admin/products/:id/publish

Admin Moodboards:
  POST   /admin/moodboards
  PUT    /admin/moodboards/:id
  DELETE /admin/moodboards/:id

### 3. **Configurable Affiliate Restrictions** 🆕

Remove the trusted retailers whitelist and allow any retailer, or enable restrictions as needed.

#### Files Updated:

#### Features:
- ✅ Optional retailer whitelist (default: disabled)
- ✅ Allow any HTTPS URL when unrestricted
- ✅ Show verification badge only when restricted
- ✅ Configurable security levels

#### Configuration:
```env
# Allow any retailer (unrestricted)
VITE_RESTRICT_AFFILIATE_RETAILERS=false

# Restrict to 22 verified retailers only
VITE_RESTRICT_AFFILIATE_RETAILERS=true
```

#### Behavior:
| Mode | Validation | Badge | Allowed URLs |
|------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| **Unrestricted** (default) | None | ❌ Hidden | Any HTTPS URL |
| **Restricted** | Whitelist check | ✅ Shown | 22 verified retailers |

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying to Production:

#### 1. **Environment Setup**
- [ ] Set `VITE_API_MODE=real` in production `.env`
- [ ] Configure `VITE_API_BASE_URL` with your backend URL
- [ ] Set `VITE_API_KEY` if using key-based authentication
- [ ] Enable `VITE_ENABLE_IMAGE_UPLOAD=true` if using uploads
- [ ] Configure `VITE_RESTRICT_AFFILIATE_RETAILERS` as needed

#### 2. **Backend Requirements**
- [ ] Backend API is deployed and accessible

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Image Upload:
- Max file size: 5MB (Devv SDK limit)
- Daily upload limit: 200 files per user
- Requires authentication (admin login)

### API Mode:
- Mock mode uses in-memory data (not persistent)
- Real mode requires backend to be deployed first

### Affiliate Restrictions:
- When unrestricted, no validation is performed
- Malicious URLs can pass through if restriction is disabled
